## ⚡ Quick Start

Install and initialize AG Kit to inject the `.agents/` configuration folder directly into your local project.

### Method 1: On-demand Execution (Recommended)

```bash
npx @vudovn/ag-kit init
```

### Method 2: Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g @vudovn/ag-kit
ag-kit init
```

---

## 🛡️ Safe Updates and Rollback

AG Kit updates are merge-aware by default. Files you created or changed locally are preserved, while clean managed files receive upstream updates.

```bash
ag-kit update --dry-run          # Preview the exact update plan
ag-kit update                    # Safe merge with backup and conflict report
ag-kit update --strategy replace # Explicit full replacement, with backup
ag-kit rollback                  # Restore the newest pre-update backup
```

Update metadata is stored in `.agents/.ag-kit/`. Backups are stored outside the toolkit at `.ag-kit-backups/`, so an interrupted or conflicting update can be reviewed or rolled back safely.

---

## 🌍 Global Shared Setup (Symlinks)

If you work across multiple repositories and want to avoid duplicating the `.agents/` folder in every single project, you can centralize AG Kit and use symbolic links.

1. **Install centrally** (e.g., to a global folder like `~/.ag-kit`):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.ag-kit && cd ~/.ag-kit
   npx @vudovn/ag-kit init
   ```

2. **Link it locally** from inside your project root:
   - **macOS / Linux:**
     ```bash
     ln -s ~/.ag-kit/.agents .agents
     ```
   - **Windows (CMD - Run as Administrator):**
     ```cmd
     mklink /D .agents "%USERPROFILE%\.ag-kit\.agents"
     ```
   - **Windows (PowerShell - Run as Administrator):**
     ```powershell
     New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path ".agents" -Target "$env:USERPROFILE\.ag-kit\.agents"
     ```

## ⚠️ Important Note on `.gitignore`

If you are using AI-native code editors (like **Antigravity**), adding the `.agents/` directory to `.gitignore` will prevent the editor's language server from indexing the workflows, which disables autocomplete for slash commands (e.g. `/plan`, `/debug`).

### Recommended Solution:
To keep `.agents/` out of your remote repository without losing editor integration:
1. Ensure `.agents/` is **NOT** listed in your project's `.gitignore`.
2. Add `.agents/` to your local Git exclude file: `.git/info/exclude` instead.

## 📦 What's Included

AG Kit packages domain-specific knowledge, specialized agent personas, and automated workflows optimized for modern AI coding tools.

| Component | Count | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agents** | 20 | Specialist AI personas (Frontend, Backend, Security, PM, QA, etc.) |
| **Skills** | 47 | Domain-specific context modules with conditional loading rules |
| **Workflows** | 13 | Pre-configured interactive developer procedures (slash commands) |

---


## 🔐 Versioned Agent Components

Starting with `2026.7.18`, every agent, skill, workflow, and rule has a strict SemVer contract. The `.agents/manifest.json` registry and `.agents/manifest.lock.json` integrity lock make dependencies machine-readable and prevent documentation/configuration drift.

```bash
npm run generate:agents # regenerate registry, lock, and dependency graph
npm run check:agents    # non-mutating release/CI verification
```

The generated `.agents/DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` shows workflow → agent → skill relationships. Official runtime support remains Gemini CLI and Google Antigravity; the registry format is portable by design.

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Zero-Setup Agent Auto-Routing

You don't need to manually orchestrate agents. The system silently classifies your request, auto-routes to the best domain experts, and applies their rules instantly:

```
You: "Add JWT authentication to the login API"
Agent: Applying @security-auditor + @backend-specialist...

You: "Align the checkout button to the center and fix dark mode"
Agent: Using @frontend-specialist...
```

### 2. Interactive Workflows (Slash Commands)

Execute structured development workflows by typing slash commands in your AI agent chat:

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/brainstorm` | Structured exploration of options and architecture before coding |
| `/coordinate` | Orchestrate multiple agents in parallel for complex reviews |
| `/create` | Create new features or full applications from scratch |
| `/debug` | Activate evidence-based systematic debugging |
| `/deploy` | Execute pre-flight checks and deploy to production |
| `/enhance` | Safely add or update features in an existing codebase |
| `/plan` | Generate a structured implementation plan and checklist |
| `/preview` | Start, stop, or check status of local preview servers |
| `/remember` | Save custom project conventions to persistent memory |
| `/status` | Generate a clear status report of the agent's progress |
| `/test` | Generate and execute comprehensive tests |
| `/verify` | Prove code works via execution rather than simple inspection |

## 🧠 Core Architectural Concepts

AG Kit is built on production-tested agentic design patterns designed to reduce token usage by **13% to 33%** while yielding higher output quality:

*   **Coordinator Mode:** Multi-agent orchestration with parallel workers and synthesis, avoiding expensive sequential retries.
*   **Persistent Memory:** A 4-type taxonomy memory engine index (`MEMORY.md`) to prevent re-explaining project guidelines across sessions.
*   **Context Compression:** Automated summarization and micro-compaction routines to prevent context degradation in long-lived sessions.
*   **Conditional Skill Loading:** Context-aware loading of rules via custom frontmatter, preventing your context window from bloating with idle instructions.

## 📚 References & Attribution

AG Kit represents an original implementation of markdown-based prompt and rules engineering. It was built by analyzing production agent patterns to distill core agentic behaviors:
*   *No proprietary code or files were copied.*
*   All templates, rules, and scripts are rewritten as original, open-source implementations under the MIT license.
